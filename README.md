# üíé C++ Data Structures & Graph Theory
Welcome to the data-structures-practical repository! This collection houses various C++ programs showcasing fundamental concepts in graph theory and data structures. From implementations of graph representations to algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Prim's algorithm, this repository offers hands-on learning opportunities for both students and developers interested in algorithms and C++ programming.

Feel free to explore the programs, study their implementations, and use them as a reference for your own projects. Contributions and feedback are always appreciated!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites


#### C++ Compiler: 
You need a C++ compiler installed on your system. Common choices include:
    GCC (GNU Compiler Collection): Available on Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS. You can install it using package managers like apt (for Ubuntu/Debian) or Homebrew (for macOS).
    
#### Clang: 
Another popular compiler, often used as an alternative to GCC. It's also available on Unix-based systems.
    Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler: If you're on Windows, you might use Visual Studio's compiler or the standalone Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler, which comes with Visual Studio Build Tools or Visual Studio Community edition.

#### Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE): 
You'll need a text editor to write your C++ code. Many developers prefer using specialized IDEs like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, CLion, Xcode, or Eclipse. However, you can also use lightweight text editors like Sublime Text, Atom, or Vim.

#### Knowledge of C++ Syntax: 
Understanding the basics of C++ syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and classes is essential for writing and running C++ programs.
